      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        internet as a place for content created by the users.<br />
        This includes social media, forums, encyclopedias and so on.<br />
        We also reached the point of a flashy and colorful time, websites stared
        to begin being interactive!
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>2006:</b>b A JavaScript framework called "jQuery" comes into place.
        It emphasized the interaction between JavaScript and HTML.

        <b>May 2013:</b> React was released. "The open-source React library is
        designed to make it easier to create user interfaces and UI components
        for web applications. React can also be used to create single-page or
        mobile applications." (From webdesignmuseum.org) Together with many
        other frameworks (e.g. Angular, VueJS), web development focuses more and
        more on the JavaScript part,
